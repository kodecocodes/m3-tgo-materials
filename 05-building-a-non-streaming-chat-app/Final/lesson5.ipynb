Based on the survey, 46 percent of software developers used Flutter. On the whole, roughly one third of mobile developers use cross-platform technologies or frameworks; the rest of mobile developers use native tools. Cross-platform mobile frameworksSimply put, cross-platform mobile frameworks are used to generate an app that is accessible through a large number of various end devices. A single code is used across multiple platforms for easy portability, and in the end the cost of software development is kept low. With cross-platform mobile frameworks, there is the possibility of maximum exposure to the target audience. For example, a single app can target both iOS and Android platforms, which maximizes the app’s reach. App developersIn 2022, there were 26.4 million software developers worldwide. The number of developers is expected to grow in the coming years, especially due to the rise of app and web development in the growing digital age. Of the various kinds of software developers, mobile developers are among the lowest on the developer pay scale. Mobile developers on average make an annual salary of over 124,000 U.S. dollars, while engineering managers are the highest-paid software developers with an annual average salary of 96,000 U.S. dollars.\\n                                Read more\\n                            \\n                        Cross-platform mobile frameworks used by software developers worldwide from 2019 to 2023\\n                    \\n                                    table\\n                                \\n                                    column chart\\n                                Characteristic20192020202120222023Flutter30%39%42%46%46%React Native42%42%38%32%35%Cordova29%18%16%10%10%Unity12%11%11%12%10%Ionic28%18%16%11%9%Other-8%10%8%9%Xamarin26%14%11%12%8%Kotlin Multiplatform-2%2%3%4%NativeScript11%5%5%3%2%PhoneGap11%6%4%2%2%Apache Flex5%2%1%1%2%Kendo Ul4%1%1%0%1%Kivy-1%1%1%1%\\n                                                Loading statistic... \\n                                            \\n                                    Additional Information\\n                                © Statista 2024\\n                                Show source\\n                                \\n                Download for free\\n            \\n                        Download\\n                    PDF+XLS+PNG+PPT+SourceShow detailed source information?Register for freeAlready a member?Log inSource\\n                                Show sources information\\n                            \\n                                Show publisher information\\n                            \\n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\\n                            \\n                            Release date\\n                        June 2023More information\\n                            Region\\n                        WorldwideSurvey time period2019 to 2023Number of respondents29,269 respondentsSpecial propertiessoftware developersCitation formatsCitation formats\\n                        View options\\n                    Other statistics on the topicSoftware developmentSoftwareMost widely utilized programming languages among developers worldwide 2024SoftwareMost popular web frameworks among developers worldwide 2024+SoftwareEnterprise software total worldwide expenditure 2009-2024+Cyber Crime & SecurityApp tracking transparency: opt-in rate of iOS users worldwide 2022\\n                                Lionel Sujay Vailshery\\n                            \\n                                Research expert covering cloud computing and emerging tech industries\\n                            Get in touch with us now\\n                    \\n                    Profit from additional features with an Employee Account\\n                \\n                \\n                    \\n                    Please create an employee account to be able to mark statistics as favorites.\\n                    Then you can access your favorite statistics via the star in the header.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Register now\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Profit from the additional features of your individual account\\n                \\n                \\n                    \\n                    Currently, you are using a shared account.

Based on the survey, 46 percent of software developers used Flutter. On the whole, roughly one third of mobile developers use cross-platform technologies or frameworks; the rest of mobile developers use native tools. Cross-platform mobile frameworksSimply put, cross-platform mobile frameworks are used to generate an app that is accessible through a large number of various end devices. A single code is used across multiple platforms for easy portability, and in the end the cost of software development is kept low. With cross-platform mobile frameworks, there is the possibility of maximum exposure to the target audience. For example, a single app can target both iOS and Android platforms, which maximizes the app’s reach. App developersIn 2022, there were 26.4 million software developers worldwide. The number of developers is expected to grow in the coming years, especially due to the rise of app and web development in the growing digital age. Of the various kinds of software developers, mobile developers are among the lowest on the developer pay scale. Mobile developers on average make an annual salary of over 124,000 U.S. dollars, while engineering managers are the highest-paid software developers with an annual average salary of 96,000 U.S. dollars.\\n                                Read more\\n                            \\n                        Cross-platform mobile frameworks used by software developers worldwide from 2019 to 2023\\n                    \\n                                    table\\n                                \\n                                    column chart\\n                                Characteristic20192020202120222023Flutter30%39%42%46%46%React Native42%42%38%32%35%Cordova29%18%16%10%10%Unity12%11%11%12%10%Ionic28%18%16%11%9%Other-8%10%8%9%Xamarin26%14%11%12%8%Kotlin Multiplatform-2%2%3%4%NativeScript11%5%5%3%2%PhoneGap11%6%4%2%2%Apache Flex5%2%1%1%2%Kendo Ul4%1%1%0%1%Kivy-1%1%1%1%\\n                                                Loading statistic... \\n                                            \\n                                    Additional Information\\n                                © Statista 2024\\n                                Show source\\n                                \\n                Download for free\\n            \\n                        Download\\n                    PDF+XLS+PNG+PPT+SourceShow detailed source information?Register for freeAlready a member?Log inSource\\n                                Show sources information\\n                            \\n                                Show publisher information\\n                            \\n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\\n                            \\n                            Release date\\n                        June 2023More information\\n                            Region\\n                        WorldwideSurvey time period2019 to 2023Number of respondents29,269 respondentsSpecial propertiessoftware developersCitation formatsCitation formats\\n                        View options\\n                    Other statistics on the topicSoftware developmentSoftwareMost widely utilized programming languages among developers worldwide 2024SoftwareMost popular web frameworks among developers worldwide 2024+SoftwareEnterprise software total worldwide expenditure 2009-2024+Cyber Crime & SecurityApp tracking transparency: opt-in rate of iOS users worldwide 2022\\n                                Lionel Sujay Vailshery\\n                            \\n                                Research expert covering cloud computing and emerging tech industries\\n                            Get in touch with us now\\n                    \\n                    Profit from additional features with an Employee Account\\n                \\n                \\n                    \\n                    Please create an employee account to be able to mark statistics as favorites.\\n                    Then you can access your favorite statistics via the star in the header.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Register now\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Profit from the additional features of your individual account\\n                \\n                \\n                    \\n                    Currently, you are using a shared account.
